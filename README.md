# Awesome ‘Vanilla’ Javascript [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A simple listing of *plain* — *[‘Vanilla’](http://vanilla-js.com/)* — Javascript resources.
Because sometimes you don't need a big library such as jQuery (which remains awesome IMO).

> **P.S.** ‘Vanilla’ JS is not *‘better’* than jQuery et. al! jQuery is a very good library. [It can be argued](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3393922) that many plugins and functions in the resources below are ‘worse’: less well documented, tested, less cross-browser compatibility, etc. However: sometimes a swiss-army knife monolith such as jQuery is too much. Tiny, reusable & modular modules FTW!
